import "x86.mm0";

-- It should suffice to use x86.mm0 directly for compiler.mm1,
-- because it (should) add no new axioms,
-- but in the interim we are using this to keep the partial proofs checked in CI:
axiom sorry (p: wff): $ p $;
term sorry_nat: nat;
term sorry_set: set;
term sorry_wff: wff;

-- Search for theorem ... = 'sorry; to find the incomplete proofs
-- (or delete the sorry axiom and see what breaks). Proofs depending on this axiom
-- also show up in the doc-gen tool in the "Axiom use" section.
